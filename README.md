# UCSD Tasks

2016 SD Hacks entry

UCSD Tasks functions as a means for UCSD campus individuals to post tasks and complete them for money. The application brings up a map of the local area with markers over the location of each task. The user can select markers to see a description of the posted task, the author, and the payment for completing the task. The user can post tasks through a create task option where they can input a task title, description, and compensation amount. The task will then be posted to their current location.
